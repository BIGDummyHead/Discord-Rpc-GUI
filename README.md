# Discord Rpc GUI

The Discord RPC GUI, is a program that allows you to fully customize your RPC for Discord. This app does not require anything user related, only the application ID that you would like to use.

### If you see any applications that require you to provide an OAuth key, User ID, and etc... something may be wrong and you may be getting SCAMMED

## Features

* Allows you to fully customize your RPC down to every nook and cranny!
* Profiles to save and load for a faster experience
* A Visualizer to see how your RPC will look in real time! (Note: the Visualizer does not have access to assets, this means that you will not be able to see images.)
* Minimize to system tray to keep out of your way!
